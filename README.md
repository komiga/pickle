## Pickle

**Pickle** is a Lua-based static site generator.

## Building

Interface headers are generated by [igen](https://github.com/komiga/igen),
which requires Python 2.x, Mako, and cindex.py (libclang wrapper).

Inclusions are sorted with [include_sort](https://github.com/komiga/include_sort)
(see `scripts/include_sort`), but it is not required to build Pickle.

See `dep/README.md` for dependency setup. Components can then be built using
my [standard project protocol](http://komiga.com/pp-cpp).

The only difference from the project protocol is `scripts/premake` in place of
Premake, which enforces recipe order to allow the use of GNU Make's `--jobs`.

## License

Pickle carries the MIT license, which can be found in the `LICENSE` file.
